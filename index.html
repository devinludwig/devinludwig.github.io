          <h3>Current Interests</h3>
            <p>Besides the internet, I have a diverse array of interests and skills that broaden my experience and contribute to my perspective as a web professional. I have toured on <span>both bicycles and motorcycles</span> along with doing most of the mechanical work on my machines. A longtime photography hobbyist, I've worked in both film and digital media to make artful portraiture, landscape photography and documentary travel series.
